          <h4>Songza Adds Context to Google Play Music</h4>
          <p>
           
          </p>
          <p>

<p>Hey, did you hear that Google is buying music curated music app <a href="http://songza.com/">Songza</a>? I&rsquo;m  very excited about this acquisition. Songza is a bit different than other streaming music apps, in that their playlists are carefully curated around context - What time of day are you listening? What&rsquo;s your mood? What activity are you participating in? - and then plays music based on that context. And I hope that Google will integrate this context directly into their own streaming music app.</p>

<p>Google is already so good at context - Google Now proves this every day. But their music streaming app could really benefit from some additional contextual help. Play Music already has great music discovery features, including an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling lucky&rdquo; radio feature which plays a random playlist based on your previous listening habits. While they make good suggestions based on what I&rsquo;ve already listened to, the service does miss out on context.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-listen-not-what-i-listen-to:116c1bc525986a94fe08e34c386a89fb"><em>Why</em> I listen, not <em>what</em> I listen to.</h2>

<p>One great example of this need for more context is on display when my auto-generated playlists are influenced by one of my most listened to playlists: lullabies for my son. We listen to these each night as we get ready for bed, and I play this playlist from my Google Music account. This influences Google&rsquo;s algorithm, and later the music Google will recommend for me.</p>

<p>With just a little bit of context - &ldquo;hey, Alan, <em>why</em> are you listening to that song?&rdquo; Google would be able to craft much better playlists - and I think that&rsquo;s exactly why they are investing in Songza.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-a-two-way-or-more-street:116c1bc525986a94fe08e34c386a89fb">Context is a two-way (or more) street.</h2>

<p>The other interesting angle of this acquisition is that Google will now get to push context to Songza. Currently, Songza gives you some interesting, time-bound playlist choices. For example, at 12:30 on Wednesday afternoon, Gave me these options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand New Music</li>
<li>Boosting Your Energy</li>
<li>Working in an Office (SFW)</li>
<li>Working (No Lyrics)</li>
<li>Going to a Festival<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Four of those options are pretty good guesses for any old Wednesday afternoon - but what if I work nights? What if I work outside, not in an office? What if I were, actually, going to a specific festival? By integrating with Google, Songza will have a much better idea of what I usually do, where I&rsquo;m going and if I&rsquo;m usually awake at this time.</p>

<p>I think that Songza is perfect for Google, and Google is perfect for Songza. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how this merger changes everything.</p>
