      <p>
       
      </p>
      <p>From time to time I need to quickly share an image or file with a colleague, a friend or client, and that&rsquo;s usually something I would do on a one-off basis by emailing, or uploading to Dropbox or something. This is a pretty easy workflow, but it could probably be easier, right? That&rsquo;s where Alex Chiri and his Dropzone action come in. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, Dropzone is a great little Mac utility that allows you to perform quick actions by dragging a file up to the icon on the menu bar.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://localhost:1313/post/keeppeddling/">Keep Peddling</a></h4>
      <p>
       
      </p>
      <p>My four year old son has his first bike. I&rsquo;ve been spending my evenings teaching him how to ride - he&rsquo;s catching on fast. One area he&rsquo;s struggling in is the turns. He&rsquo;s not confident, or not focused, and he tips over in the turns. I was jogging after him, shouting advice, when I realized my advice has implications far beyond beginners cycling - keep peddling and look where you want to be.</p>

      <p>
       
      </p>
      <p>A few weeks ago I participated in a round of interviews for an open position on our Customer Success Team. I conducted my portion of the interview with my teammate Bill. I always like listening to Bill - he has wonderful insights, and asks great questions. I truly appreciated one question he asked in the interview: &ldquo;Is the customer always right?&rdquo; Fortunately, not one of the candidates answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Wait - What?</p>

      <p>
       
      </p>
      <p>Hey, did you hear that Google is buying music curated music app Songza? I&rsquo;m very excited about this acquisition. Songza is a bit different than other streaming music apps, in that their playlists are carefully curated around context - What time of day are you listening? What&rsquo;s your mood? What activity are you participating in? - and then plays music based on that context. And I hope that Google will integrate this context directly into their own streaming music app.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://localhost:1313/post/coldbrew/">Cold Brewed Benchmarks</a></h4>
      <p>
       
      </p>
      <p>Last week I read an article on Lifehacker about a less messy way to cold brew coffee. As a fan of cold brewed coffee, wanted to try this. Cold brewing is very easy, but it does leave a bit of a mess. I needed to be able to brew my coffee quickly, easily and with as little mess as possible. The Lifehacker article describes what appears to be a very simple, no cleanup version of the cold brewing process with little to no filtering needed.</p>

      <p>The part where I welcome you to version X.Y of my blog. Where &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; are numbers larger than I would like to admit. Let&rsquo;s just call it iteration number ten. I&rsquo;ve built this blog on the Pelican Framework, with a large dose of help from Justin Phelp&rsquo;s two guides to blog automation with Pelican. Why Pelican? I wanted to build a simple, static site that I can post directly as HTML - either through my own server, or on a Rackspace Cloud Files Container.</p>
