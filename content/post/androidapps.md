Title = "Recommended Android Apps"

+++

A friend just got her first Android phone, so I put together a quick list of apps I think are well worth an install. This is by no means a complete list, just a start.

### All of the Google Apps. Most of them aren't the default on a Samsung device, and it's well worth it to either install them or set them up as your default.

* [Google Now Launcher][1] - provides the default Google Android Experience - No Samsung/HTC crap interface.
* [Android Device Manager][2] - remotely manage your device. Locate it when it's lost. Remote wipe.
* [Google Opinion Rewards][3] - Answer the occasional survey, get some change added to your Play account. Buy more games.
* [Inbox by Gmail][4] - replacement for standard Gmail app. Allows you to quickly manage email, and take action on your mail.
* [Google Play Music][5] - Now with Songza integration. Great way to pick out music for whatever you're doing.
* Google+ - Just a fan, don't mind me. But it comes with the Photos app, which has some great editing tools.
* [Chrome Browser][6] - Don't use the default browser. Just don't.

### Misc

* [Car Home Ultra][7] - Turns your phone into a dashboard while you drive.
* [Authy 2-Factor Authentication][8]
* [BeyondPod][9] - Podcast catcher/player w/ beautiful design and variable speed playback
* [Pushbullet][10] - Mirror selected notifications from your device to your computer. Great to see who's calling, etc.
* [Link Bubble Browser][11] - Open links in a 'bubble,' then open those bubbles individually. Prevents you from having to jump back and forth between apps.
* [Life Time Alarm Clock][12] - A great alarm clock app. Easy to use, and works well.
* [LastPass][13] - Keeps all of your passwords safe. Will copy/paste your passwords into new apps. Huge time saver.

### Work

* [MappedIn][14] - Internal Maps. My workplace is mapped here, and I can find my way around much better.
* [Nine][15] - Exchange/Active Sync client. Holy crap, this is a great app. Easily worth the $10 price tag.
* [RSA Token][16] - Instead of the key fob

### Fun/Distraction/Just Plain Dumb Apps

* [Hodor Keyboard][17] - Hodor! Hodor hodor, hodor; hodor hodor?! Hodor. Hodor hodor hodor hodor... Hodor hodor hodor...
* [Imgur][18] - Cats, gifs, etc.
* [Photofy Photo Editing Collage][19] - Make photo collages. Add words to them. Share them.
