**TL;DR**: I purchased two copies of a book to send one each to my sisters and their families. I mailed them both via USPS "Priority Mail 3-Day" shipping. My sister in Alaska received hers in 3 days. My sister in Kansas City, MO still hasn't received hers. as of publication, we're at 15 and a half days.
