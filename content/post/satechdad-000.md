I finally got to start something I've been hoping to do for quite some time now. My good friend Drew Cox cohosts a weekly video podcast with me. We really enjoy the format, and have been very helpful to many of our customers at work. But we also have interests outside of work, namely our families, nerdy technology things, and the delicious food and beverages that can be found here in San Antonio. We've talked about hosting a podcast for a long time, but never pulled the trigger. Parallel to this, we've also both become friends with Coredy Dockendorf, a fellow Racker, nerd, and father. He seemed like a great third host to pull in, and last night we finally took Nike's advice and just did it. 
Here's episode 0 of the SA Tech Dad show. Enjoy.
