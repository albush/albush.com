The good news is I'm performing improv comedy on Saturday. The bad news is I don't get to make stuff up with my friends as much as I would like. I think that's just a fact of this stage of my life. I don't have to like it, but there it is.

I started performing improv in High School. That's over half a lifetime ago. We practiced or performed at least once a week then. In college, I performed as often as possible - not as much as I would like, but several times a month. The magical period between college and married with children was filled almost exclusively with improv. I don't want to go back to the rest of that lifestyle, but I do miss the community of improvisors we built up during that time.
