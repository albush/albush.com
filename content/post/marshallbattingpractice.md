Over the weekend my almost 5 year old son and I had a guys day. We had flapjacks for breakfast, went to the coffee shop, and ate at our favorite restaurant, and read some books together. But our favorite part of the day was hitting up the batting cages for to hit some balls.

Marshall has always loved baseball. He gets home from school, and asks to go right outside and start playing. He'd play all day, if we let him. He's also got a pretty decent swing, and has recently started hitting "home runs" out of our little backyard. So we went to the batting cages and let him swing away.

The kid can hit. Especially off of a tee. He's pretty good when we pitch to him, but he _really_ likes to swing the bat. His plate discipline reminds me of Royals catcher [Salvador Perez](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/theres-nothing-salvador-perez-wont-swing-at/), who has a cannon for an arm, lots of power, but sometimes looks like he might be a better cricket than baseball player.

I don't think I can quite retire, yet, but I'm sure we'll be back for more fun at the batting cages soon - we just had too much fun.
