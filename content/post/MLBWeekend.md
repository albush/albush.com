Title = "What to do in San Antonio"

I'm looking forward to the upcoming [Big League Weekend](//www.bigleagueweekend.com/), San Antonio's only chance to see Major League Baseball played in our town. It'll be interesting to see how they convert the Alamodome to a baseball stadium, and the Fan Fest looks like it'll be a lot of fun.

I know there are some Royals fans headed down this way to see the Royals play. This will be a good chance to show off some of the best that San Antonio has to offer. The Fan Fest and games will take up quite a bit of the weekend, but there are a few restaurants, bars, and attractions that I recommend anyone staying a few days in town check out.

I made a map. My buddy [Drew Cox](https://twitter.com/DrewCoxSA) is a prodigious list maker. He's got a list for everything, and his lists are always extremely complete. I took his "What To Do in San Antonio" list and map, and distilled it to a more compact list. I also created a specific list of about 10 "best bets," that I think are most worth checking out. The map is embedded below, be sure to check out the full-sized map for details and additional layers of information.

If you're in town for Big League Weekend be sure to [give me a shout](https://twitter.com/alanbush), I'd be happy to say hi, and maybe grab a beer.
