Title: How I Became a Community Manager
draft: true
---

When I first started to appreciate the difference between a "job" and a "career," I was working for a small healthcare PPO network in Southwest Missouri, Employers Health Network (EHN). I have had my share of "jobs" and "gigs," but this role was one I could grow with. In theory I was hired to help with some filing and data entry, but more and more I was asked to work on special projects to select and implement the technology that EHN would use to operate and grow our business.

One of the technologies I investigated (and subsequently selected) was from a collaboration startup called Central Desktop (now [iMeet Central](https://www.imeetcentral.com/)). Early in my research, my project leader, Jason Eckersley, suggested that I become active in the Central Desktop community. As a small startup, Central Desktop relied on a community forum to answer many of their customers questions. Jason's advice was to become an active member of the Community, not just asking questions and waiting for an answer, but answering other users' questions. His reasoning was that, by becoming a trusted community member, I would gain goodwill from our fellow community members, and the company, and hopefully be able to translate that goodwill into improved support for EHN down the road.

Jason's plan worked. And along the way, I also managed to become an authority on Central Desktop. We chose Central Desktop as our platform, and started to push the limits on what we could do with the platform. I continued to be active in the community forum, both in asking for advice on new and unique ways to push the platform, and in answering other users' questions. I was awarded a "Hero" designation in their forum, and that only encouraged me. As I discovered new uses for Central Desktop, I blogged about them, so that other users could apply them for their own use. I was a featured guest on the Central Desktop Blog, and shared some of my workflows on a webinar.

Two years into becoming a Central Desktop power user, EHN went out of business. Fortunately, my connections at Central Desktop were there for me. Central Desktop was starting a program aimed at proactive customer success. They would provide direct access to new customers to develop customized plans to improve collaboration through Central Desktop's platform. My two years volunteering in Central Desktop's forum acted as my resume and my interview, and I became one of Central Desktop's first Implementation Consultants.

Two years later, I moved on to [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com) to help them build a similar proactive customer success team, the Cloud Launch Team. I'm very proud of the work that we accomplished on that team. We worked with hundreds of new customers, and helped them build the tools they need to make their businesses strong.

One of the first meetings I attended at Rackspace was an informational session on the launch of the [Rackspace Community Forum](https://community.rackspace.com/). The Rackspace Community launched with an initial focus on explaining our products and providing guides. There was little emphasis on understanding our customers and helping them solve the problems they faced. Our customers organically turned the Community Forum into a question and answer forum. We realized this was a good opportunity for us to be helpful to our customers who were not interacting with us on the Cloud Launch Team, or who had been longtime customers and needed non-time-sensitive help. The role of Technical Community Manager was born.

The role of a Technical Community Manager at Rackspace is mostly to help our customers find the information they need to be successful in their business.
