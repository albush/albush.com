Alan Bush is a founding member of the Technical Community Manager role at Rackspace. Alan helps Rackspace customers, Rackers, and the public achieve success in the cloud through one-on-one and one-to-many interactions - including Community Forum support, videos, live presentation, blogging, and social media.

Alan also helped to architect Rackspace's Cloud Launch Team. During his time on the Launch Team, Alan helped more than 100 new cloud consumers get started with cloud hosting, developed a weekly live video show - Office Hours Hangouts, was one of the first 175 Rackers to become certified "Cloud Savvy," and was awarded the Fanatical Jacket, Rackspace's highest honor for outstanding customer support.

Before Rackspace, Alan helped create the Stevie Award winning onboarding program for Central Desktop - a really cool cloud collaboration suite - where he worked directly with companies and organizations like MLB.com, Sesame Workshop, and IEEE. When he's not helping customers learn how to build awesome things in the cloud, Alan can be found performing improv comedy with [Comedy Sportz San Antonio][1], or dreaming up new styles for his award-winning mustache.
