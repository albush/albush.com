            Alan Bush is a founding member and architect of Rackspace's Cloud Launch Team. During his time on the Launch Team, Alan helped more than 100 new cloud consumers get started with cloud hosting, developed a weekly live video show - Office Hours Hangouts, was one of the first 175 Rackers to become certified "Cloud Savvy," and was awarded the Fanatical Jacket, Rackspace's highest honor for outstanding customer support.

            Before Rackspace, Alan helped create the Stevie Award winning onboarding program for cloud collaboration suite Central Desktop, where he worked directly with companies and organizations like MLB.com, Sesame Workshop, and IEEE. When he's not helping customers learn how to build awesome things in the cloud, Alan can be found performing improv comedy with ComedySportz San Antonio, or dreaming up new styles for his award-winning mustache.
