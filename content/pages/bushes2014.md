Our year [started in Missouri](https://plus.google.com/100903393398867345579/stories/a256e00a-d0fc-365f-a0ba-c700f44d6d851460fdcaa57?authkey=CPG7p7KO5LL9rQE) where we saw snow, family, more snow, sub-zero temperatures and more snow than we ever want to see again. It was a good reminder of one of the many reasons we enjoy living in South Texas. (Seriously, the high - **the high** - was -3 F the day we left to head back to Texas.)

We started by surprising Nani and Aunt Lisa, then surprising the rest of our relatives in Kansas City before taking a very sick Simon to St. Louis to visit Julie's side of the family.

Simon got bigger, turned 1, started talking, is now arguing with us. He's a fun little guy and his personality is really starting to show.

Marshall played t-ball this spring and really enjoyed it. He continued to practice through the summer and fall, and has turned into a big baseball fan. [He turned four in March](http://drops.albush.com/marshall4.jpg), moved up a class in preschool, and will start Kindergarten next August. He starts Tae Kwon Do in January.

Alan won the Fanatical Jacket at Rackspace - The company's highest honor - for his work on a weekly video broadcast.

He's been with Rackspace for just over 2 years now, and is still enjoying every minute of it. Alan also occasionally works with Comedy Sportz San Antonio - they just moved into an awesome new theatre.

Julie is still enjoying work in pediatric home health. She hit the [3 year mark with Step By Step in June](https://plus.google.com/100903393398867345579/stories/91ba3a97-3512-393a-bbd0-867f46a092f1146c485e6e9?authkey=CPrK9Paygb-Xfg). She ran a few races, saved the earth from an alien invasion, and baked some really tasty cookies. 
	
We took [another trip to Missouri and Illinois in September](https://plus.google.com/100903393398867345579/stories/f56c4530-072f-32b5-863d-3865eac19c411487379ce5b?authkey) and saw as many people as we could. We got to see a Royals game - they lost to the Red Sox, but Marshall had so much fun. It's the only time in my life I can remember seeing watching the Royals while they were in first place. We went to Julie's family reunion and got caught up with most of the Jungers'. Marshall got to go on his first fishing trip, and caught quite the fish.

We spent lots of our weekends going to the zoo and Six Flags. Simon loves the animals, and Marshall is getting into the rides at Six Flags.

We all had fun watching the Royals go all the way to the World Series this year, and Marshall can name all of the players. 

Alan snuck back to Kansas City in November to take in a Chiefs game. The Chiefs lost and it was roughly 20 F the whole time, but time with friends and family is always well spent.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this a great year for The Bushes. Have a safe and happy holiday season, we'll see you next year.
