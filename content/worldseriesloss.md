Title: World Series Loss
Author: Alan Bush
Status: draft

I've been alive for almost 35 years, which is about as long as I've been a Kansas City Royals fan. My family is a baseball family; my father taught me the game, showed me how to appreciate the pace and strategy of the game, and my love of the sport grew. I had the benefit of starting my baseall fandom at the end of the Royals golden age. I was 5 when they won the World Series. I spent the next 29 years waiting, hoping that they would get better. My wait is finally over.
