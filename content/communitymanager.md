Title: Becoming a Community Manager
Author: Alan Bush

Next week I transition to my second job at Rackspace, a Technical Community Manager. I'm very excited, since this role will allow me to spend more of my time extending one-to-many support. I think that my strengths lie in expanding individual support interactions for broader consumption. 

I'll be working in our Community Forums and answering as many questions as I can and then looping in other teams for help as needed. I get to work with many additional teams, learning more with each interaction. I'll also be able to work toward my goal of more consistently representing Rackspace and sharing our vision of the future of cloud computing.
