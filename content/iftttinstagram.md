Title: Instant Instagram Gratification

I want instant gratification. Especially on Twitter. It's 140 characters short. Give me the info, and let me look at the next tweet. So when I see a tweet linking to Instagram, sometimes I don't follow the link. I don't want to wait an extra few seconds to open a new tab, wait for Instagram to load, look at the picture, then head back to Twitter. Especially on a mobile device. Especially because I don't actually use Instagram and can't find this content anywhere else. 

## There is a better way

Enter If This Then That, a great service that uses "recipes" to run workflows, connecting apps together. Here's one for you Instagram users to natively embed Instagram images into the Twitter timeline
