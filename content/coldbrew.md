Title: Cold Brewed Benchmarks

Summary: The only difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.

Last week I read an article on Lifehacker about [a less messy way to cold brew coffee][1]. As a fan of cold brewed coffee, wanted to try this. Cold brewing is very easy, but it does leave a bit of a mess. I needed to be able to brew my coffee quickly, easily and with as little mess as possible.  
The Lifehacker article describes what appears to be a very simple, no cleanup version of the cold brewing process with little to no filtering needed. - that's my Holy Grail, to be able to go straight from brewing to drinking without having to filter. I'm not there yet. 

I tried the method, and it worked, somewhat.  I still had way too much sediment that escaped the bag - I needed to filter the coffee before it was fit to drink. But I ended up with a passable result. And, now I have a solid benchmark to point back to as I adjust more variables. 

After making my first batch of coffee, I co-hosted a [live Google Plus Hangout about benchmarking cloud applications][2]. It was a great reminder that all I had done was fool around with my coffee routine. I had no way to actually generate a baseline from which I could iterate. So this time I went back and made some notes. Now we'll keep adding to this and see how I progress from there.
