## Office Hours Hangouts

<a href="http://go.rackspace.com/officehours"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Cloud Office Hours Hangouts" src="/images/officehours.jpeg" style="padding-bottom: 5px;"></a>


Office Hours is a weekly live video hangout discussing cloud best practices, new developments in the cloud, and helpful third party tools. Co Host Drew Cox and I have hosted over 50 hangouts with Rackers, Customers, and Rackspace Marketplace partners. Our shows continue to be used as a reference internally by Rackers in Sales, Marketing, and Support.

Some videos I've helped to produce - through on-screen appearances and script development. There is allegedly a video which includes a me shaving with a hedge trimmer.
