About
-----

I help connect people with the information they need to make awesome things in the cloud. I enjoy creating new teams. I'm currently building the Technical Community Manager team at Rackspace. I also was a founding member & architect of Rackspace's Cloud Launch Team. 

During my time on the Launch Team, I helped more than 100 new cloud consumers get started with cloud hosting, developed a weekly live video show - Office Hours Hangouts, was one of the first 175 Rackers to become certified "Cloud Savvy," and was awarded the Fanatical Jacket, Rackspace's highest honor for outstanding customer support.

Before Rackspace, I helped create the Stevie Award winning onboarding program for cloud collaboration suite Central Desktop, where I worked directly with companies and organizations like MLB.com, Sesame Workshop, and IEEE. When I'm not helping customers learn how to build awesome things in the cloud, I can be found performing improv comedy with ComedySportz San Antonio, or dreaming up new styles for my award-winning mustache.
