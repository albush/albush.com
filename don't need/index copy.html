# Nerd #

I've always been a nerd. It took me a long time to come to terms with that, but it's true. I'm a nerd. Or a geek. Not sure which one is the correct genus for me, but I definitely fall into that range. I have several projects, on going, that I work on slowly. 

## Learning All The Things ##

This is my quest to become a slightly better hacker. Hacker in that good way - taking something and making it different or better.

### Things I Want to Learn ###

- [Python][python]
- Better html/css
- Shell Scripting
- [Message Queues][mq]

### Things I've Already Learned ###

- Enough Linux to know *how* I broke something
- Basic html/css
